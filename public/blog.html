            <p>The first day's assignment was really confusing for me because I hadn't done anything like it before. We had to fix syntax errors and then change HTML classes to match the CSS elements so everything worked correctly.</p>
            <p>I didn't know there was a strategy, so I was just guessing. I got worried that if I couldn't do the first assignment maybe I'd made a tiny huge mistake!</p>

            <p>The second assignment was to use the grid system and floats to make Github profiles. We went onto Github and found people who had worked on different projects and used their information in our grids.</p>
            <p>This assignment was a lot easier for me to understand than the first one, and I learned about putting things in spans so they're inline from the start.</p>

          <div class="card-bottom">
            <p>The third assignment was to do a grid using Octocats, which I really liked. We got to choose which Octocats we used, and since we'd done a similar grid the day before that made it easier to know how to do things.</p>
            <p>I thought this assignment was fun and it helped me feel more comfortable with the grid. Also the Octocats are really cute!</p>

          <div class="card-bottom">
            <p>The fourth assignment was using floats to remake a screen from a video game. I'm not a gamer so I had to spend some time figuring out what was what before I started doing any actual coding.</p>
            <p>Once I got a better idea of the names of the icons I liked learning about how to set up my HTML correctly to make things move around the page.</p>
